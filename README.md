Package Version
python 3.6.8
numpy  1.16.1                    

This is an iterative procedure to compute the poster probabilities of given data. 
It is an effective method to compute the densities of a given data set. 
This algorithm provide a demonstration of expectation maximization algorithm with various steps.
Initially two lists are generated with different scale and loc using normal distributions. Both lists are combined.
Then the expectation maximization algorithm is executed on the data.
Two iterations are demonstrated here, which could be extend to 'n' number of iterations.
